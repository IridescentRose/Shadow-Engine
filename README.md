# Shadow Engine
Shadow Engine is a basic game engine designed for the PSP, used most recently in Minecraft PSP. It has since been deprecated, but its source code is now open for public use and educational benefit.

Shadow is hardware-accelerated and uses the GPU with native sceGu calls to perform rendering. However, it does not use the Media Engine, and uses the VFPU sparingly.

It is fully documented in code.
